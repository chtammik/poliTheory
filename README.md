# poliTheory

This document contains some thoughts on how the world is structured.

## politics

> the distribution of power

- all politics are inherently violent through enforcement
	- of law (police force)
	- borders (military)

## capitalism

- control of the means of production
	- those with capital can sell other peoples labour at profit
	- capital gains
- freedom of trade
- infinte growth myth
- violence to enforce capitalism
	- threat of eviction
	- preventable poverty to maintain **motivation** to work

## liberalism / the centre

> the status quo

- self-declaredly pro democracy
	- although this is not an ideal liberals are keen to act upon
- pro civil rights, secularism, gender and race equality, internationalism
- pro freedom markets / capitalism
	- power bartered to the wealthy
	- remove barriers to trade
- law & order
	- community of & solidarity through capacity/strength 
	- reinforcing wealth disparities
	- platforming fascists
	- risk managing the possibilities of terrorism (which is a response to liberal hegemonies)
- interventionist
	- often to protect economic interests (see middle east)
- unwillingness to question the underlying systems of capitalism
- support for anti-communist ideologies (to protect capitalists)
	- as seen in Germany, Italy, early 21st century right wing trends
	- ground for gradual transition into fascism

### we are at a political cross-road

- liberal politics have allowed capitalism to flourish
- pandering to capitalist ideology while throwing working class under the bus
- blatant growing inequality
	- wage stagnation
	- gentrification
	- corporate & bank bailouts
	- austerity
	- tax cuts for the rich
- deterioration of social securities
	- cutbacks in government spending
- 21st century capitalism is failing
	- negative interest
	- bankrupt countries
- pushes working class people to seek alternative

## fascism

> [fascism is] a form of political behaviour marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion
>
>Robert Paxton
