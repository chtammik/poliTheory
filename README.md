# poliTheory

This document contains some thoughts on how the world is structured.

politics

- definition:
	- the distribution of power
	- all politics are inherently violent through enforcement
		- of law (police force)
		- borders (military)

- capitalism

	- watch yannis varufakis
	- capital gains
		- earn wealth without doing work 
	- freedom of trade
	- infinte growth
	- violence to enforce capitalism
		- threat of eviction
		- preventable poverty to maintain motivation to work

- liberalism / the center

	- selfdeclaredly pro democracy
		- although this is not an ideal liberals are keen to act upon

	- interventionist
		- often to protect economic interests (see middle east)
	- unwillingness to question the underlying systems of capitalism
	- support for anti-communist ideologies (to protect capitalits)

- facism

	- definitions
		- Robert Paxton says that fascism is "a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion".
